# 🌍🐾 **4SC: Semi-Supervised Learning for Species Conservation** 🐾🌍
---

## 🌟 Overview

**4SC** (**Semi-Supervised Learning for Species Classification**) is a machine learning framework designed to aid **wildlife conservation efforts**. The repository combines **cutting-edge semi-supervised learning techniques** with domain-specific tools like **RSBank** and **RSEmbed** to tackle challenges in species classification, including:

- 🌿 **Handling imbalanced datasets** (e.g., rare species underrepresentation)
- 🐦 **Improving recognition of endangered species** with limited labeled data
- 🌏 **Reducing pseudo-label biases** for unlabeled datasets

Whether you're a researcher in machine learning or a wildlife conservationist, **4SC** provides powerful tools to accelerate your efforts in protecting biodiversity. 🌱

## 🌳 Key Features

### 🦌 **Rare Species Bank (RSBank)**  
A dedicated module for organizing and leveraging **rare species data** to ensure underrepresented species are effectively trained and classified.

### 🦋 **Rare Species Embedding (RSEmbed)**  
An **attention-based embedding mechanism** that enhances the model's ability to differentiate rare species by learning high-quality representations from both labeled and pseudo-labeled data.

### 🐾 **4SC Model**  
Our core **semi-supervised learning system** integrates RSBank and RSEmbed, along with advanced augmentation techniques, to deliver **state-of-the-art performance** on species classification tasks.

### 🌿 **Augmentation Techniques**  
Includes **RandAugment**, a data augmentation strategy to improve model robustness by generating diverse training samples.
